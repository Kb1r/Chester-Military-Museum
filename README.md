# Chester Military Museum Accessibility App

This Android application was developed to make the Chester Military Museum more inclusive for every visitor. Our main goal was to help people who have trouble reading or understanding exhibits by providing tools like text-to-speech and instant language translation. 

To keep the experience authentic to the museum, certain features require a specific access code that visitors get on-site.

## Core Features

* **Multilingual Support:** The app is fully localized in English, Polish, and Welsh to serve the local community and international visitors.
* **Text-to-Speech:** Provides audio descriptions of exhibit labels to assist visitors with visual impairments or dyslexia.
* **Dynamic Text Size:** Users can adjust the font size across the app for better readability.
* **Integrated Museum Services:** Quick access to the digital gift shop, ticket booking, and a direct contact form.
* **Interactive Map:** Includes a digital version of the museum's layout to help with wayfinding.

## Tech Stack & Architecture

We used a modern development approach to keep the code clean and easy to update:

* **Language:** Kotlin
* **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
* **Storage:** SQLite with Room persistence
* **UI:** Material Design 3 guidelines
